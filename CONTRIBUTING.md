# Contributing

Want to contribute to Rotonde? There are a few things you need to know.

## Open Development

All work on Rotonde happens directly on [GitHub](https://github.com/merveilles/Rotonde). Both core team members and external contributors send pull requests which go through the same review process.

## Bugs

### Where to Find Known Issues

We are using [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/merveilles/Rotonde/issues) for our public bugs. Before filing a new issue, try to make sure your problem doesn't already exist.

### Reporting New Issues

The best way to get your bug fixed is to provide a reduced test case.

## Proposing a Change

If you intend to make changes to any of the first-party Rotonde packages, or make any non-trivial changes in their implementation, we recommend [filing an issue](https://github.com/merveilles/Rotonde/issues/new). This lets us reach an agreement on your proposal before you put significant effort into it.

If you're only fixing a bug, it's fine to submit a pull request right away but we still recommend to file an issue detailing what you're fixing. This is helpful in case we don't accept that specific fix but want to keep track of the issue.
